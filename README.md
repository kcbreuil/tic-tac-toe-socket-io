# Tic Tac Toe

An implementation of the tic tac toe game using Socket.IO. 

To run this game: 

1. Clone this repository

2. Comment out const socket = io.connect('https://serene-atoll-67031.herokuapp.com/'); and un-comment const socket = io.connect('http://localhost:5000');

3. Run `npm install`

4. Run `npm start`

5. Go to http://localhost:5000/

(or access the game at https://serene-atoll-67031.herokuapp.com/)

I followed the tutorial at https://ayushgp.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe-Socket-IO/ to create the tic-tac-toe game (and had to look at their git repo for some ES6 updates)

Then I added a chat system for each game room. I originally said I was going to do a snake game but I decided I wanted to use WebSockets because I did the tech video about them. 

And I figured I would try doing a tic-tac-toe game with them and implementing the chat system.

I definitely worked on this for longer than I worked on project 1. I learned a lot about socket.io and I am very comfotable with it now! I also was able to figure out how to deploy my node.js app on Heroku!

This was a fun project and I liked the final product.
